Had problems running makefile, I performed the following steps to compile and run my code:

1. open command prompt
2. change directory to UBCSailbot-software-quiz/c-cpp 
3. ran the following lines on command line to run my cpp code:

    g++ *.cpp cutest/CuTest.c -Wall -o test_standard_calc.exe
    ./test_standard_calc.exe
